# Medical-Image-Analysis

Skin is an extraordinary human structure. It often suffers from several far-famed and unknown diseases. 
According to dermatology, it is a regular practice to do extensive tests on patients to ascertain the kind of skin illness they have been afflicted with. 
The duration of time varies from one practitioner to the next, depending on their experience. 
Therefore, diagnosis of human skin diseases is the most unsure and sophisticated branch of science. 
it's been ascertained that the majority of the cases stay disregarded due to the shortage of higher medical infrastructure and facilities. 

Our work aims at providing an automated image-based method for diagnosing and categorizing skin problems that uses image processing and machine learning classification. 
With an easy-to-use User Interface. We have also added the segmentation image filter so that we can have better image analysis and accurate classified results.
